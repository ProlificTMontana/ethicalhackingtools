How it works:

Stores passwords securely by encrypting them locally with symmetric encryption (Fernet). It can generate strong random passwords, encrypt and save them labeled by user input, and later decrypt and display saved passwords.

How to use:

Run the script:

python password_manager.py
Choose from the menu to generate/save a password or retrieve an existing one. Passwords are stored encrypted in passwords.json.
