How it works:

Collects forensic system information useful during a security incident automatically including system details, running processes, network connections, and disk usage. Saves this info to a timestamped report file for later analysis.

How to use:

Run without arguments:

python incident_response_automation.py

It creates an incident report file under incident_reports/ directory with gathered data.
