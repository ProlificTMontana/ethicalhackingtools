How it works:

Takes a block of text (such as an email) from user input, extracts URLs, and applies simple heuristic checks to detect suspicious URLs using keyword matching and pattern detection (e.g., unusual domain names or IP address URLs).

How to use:

Run the script:

python phishing_detection.py

Paste or type the email/text content line by line, then enter an empty line to analyze. 

The tool outputs any URLs it detects as potentially phishing.
